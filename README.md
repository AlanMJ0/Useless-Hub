# Useless Hub 🎯

## Basic Details
**Team Name:** local-hostages

### Team Members
- **Member 1:** Aanand Krishnan  
- **Member 2:** Alan Shoby

## Project Description
A comprehensive collection of 13 completely pointless yet oddly satisfying web applications designed to waste time productively. From virtual bubble wrap to fake loading screens, each app serves absolutely no practical purpose but delivers maximum entertainment value.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are being too productive and efficient with their time. There's a severe lack of meaningless yet engaging activities that can help procrastinate effectively while still feeling like you're doing something important.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created the ultimate hub of uselessness - a collection of web applications that serve no purpose other than pure entertainment. Features include clicking counters that count nothing, progress bars that progress nowhere, and bubble wrap that doesn't even pop real bubbles!
